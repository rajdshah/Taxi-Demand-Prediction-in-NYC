# Taxi-Demand-Prediction-in-NYC
The main objective of this problem is to predict the the number of pickups for a given location. Analysed the data and extracted basic features like speed,time for each trip in the dataset. Clustered all the locations in the dataset using k-means, as k-means algorithm creates clusters of same size. Divided the whole timeframe (i.e, from january 2016 to march 2016) into 10 min interval bins and assigned each datapoint with a pickup_bin based on the pickup time of the trip. Calculated number of pickups that happened at each 10 min interval time of every cluster (location). Visualized the timeseries of number of pickups for every cluster. Applied SGD Regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Decision Trees Regressor and XGBoost Regressor on top of the extracted features. Compared all the models using PrettyTable.
